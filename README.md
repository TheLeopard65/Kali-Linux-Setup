## `update.sh`

Performs a clean and efficient system update to keep tools and packages current. Here are the actions it takes:

* Performs System package update
* Performs Full-upgrade
* Performs Autoremove
* Updates:

  * Searchsploit Local DB `searchsploit -u`
  * Nmap NSE scripts `nmap --script-updatedb`
  * Local Filesystem location DB `updatedb`

### Usage:

```bash
sudo ./update.sh
```

---

## `croncreator.sh`

Sets up a **monthly cron job** to auto-run `update.sh`. Here is what it does:

1. Verifies `root` permissions
2. Copies `update.sh` to `/root/.update.sh`
3. Sets correct file permissions
4. Creates a cronjob to run it monthly:

   * **Schedule**: `0 0 1 * *`
   * **Log Output**: `/var/log/update.log`

### Usage:

```bash
sudo ./croncreator.sh
```

---

## `get-tools.sh`

Downloads an arsenal of **additional Linux and Windows post-exploitation tools** into a structured directory for CTFs, assessments, and real-world ops.

### Toolsets:

* `linux` â€“ PEAS, LinEnum, pspy, GTFOBins, and more
* `windows` â€“ Sysinternals, winPEAS, PowerSploit, Rubeus, etc.
* `misc` â€“ BloodHound, DNSCat2, SharpHound, Chisel, Ligolo
* `all` â€“ Runs all three above

### Usage:

```bash
sudo ./get-tools.sh [linux|windows|misc|all]
```

---

## `bashrc`

Custom Bash configuration that:

* Improves prompt visibility
* Enables color and shortcuts
* Can be optionally applied via `install.sh`

*The original is available as `bashrc-backup` in case of any issues.*

---

## `nanorc`

* Improves the default Nano experience and UI.
* Enable better Mouse and Keyboard Control.
* Enables syntax highlighting for many file types
* Can be installed automatically via `install.sh`
